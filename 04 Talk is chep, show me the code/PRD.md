## props
- properties which can pass to the props in the component
- props are used to pass the data from one component to another 
- props like a argument which is pass in function in js
- we can also destructure props in the component
- when we pass data to a component that is called props

## keys in component
- keys are used to identify the component all components are different to each other and which component we have which data  that all knowing help us to key
- <example> suppose we have no keys to identify key so when we make any chanages in our components that time its all components are re-rendered and that time our performance is decrease and all card are rerender again and again and react concept is not to re-render again where we not make any change that a reason we give a unique key for our component
- <note> react say not use index as a keys
